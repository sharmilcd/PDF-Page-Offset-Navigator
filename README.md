# 📄 PDF Page Offset Navigator

## 🔍 Why use this?

Many PDFs have an offset between the page numbers shown in the document and the ones in the PDF viewer. This tool lets you enter that offset once, then navigate easily using the correct page numbers from the document.

## 🚀 How it works

1. Open a PDF in your browser.
2. Click the extension icon.
3. Enter:
   - The page number you were *trying* to go to (e.g., from the table of contents).
   - The actual page you landed on in the viewer.
4. The extension calculates and saves the offset.
5. Now, just enter any logical page number and hit **Go** — it will take you to the correct page.
